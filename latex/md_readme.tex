\hypertarget{md_readme_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysubsubsection{Assignment description\+: This Homework assignment aims to derive the forward kinematics and a partial inverse kinematic function for a manipulator and implement them in a robot simulator. To do this you are provided with a C library containing the simulator. All your code should be written in the file kin fncs.\+c which contains 2 main functions, fwd kin(theta,x) and inv kin(x, theta). These functions are directly called by the simulator}\label{md_readme_autotoc_md2}

To install it under Ubuntu, you need to install a number of extra packages with the development libraries\+: {\ttfamily apt-\/get install build-\/essential} {\ttfamily apt-\/get install xutils-\/dev} {\ttfamily apt-\/get install libxt-\/dev} {\ttfamily apt-\/get install libxaw7-\/dev} Put the tar file on your on your computer and uncompress it. In a terminal\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Go to the project folder (kin or dyn)\+: {\ttfamily cd $\sim$/$<$path to where you put the file$>$/hwk1\+\_\+\+Linux64/kin}
\item Build the Makefile (you only have to do this once)\+: {\ttfamily xmkmf}
\item Compile the project\+: {\ttfamily make}
\item This will produce a few warnings and show you whether there were errors (ignore the can not build Kinematics.\+man error -\/ this is just that it does not find documentation to build)
\item Run the executable\+: {\ttfamily ./\+Kinematics} 
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md_readme_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysection{Code Explanation}\label{md_readme_autotoc_md4}

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\bfseries{Function Declarations}}\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The code declares three functions\+: {\ttfamily print\+\_\+jacobian}, {\ttfamily jacobian}, {\ttfamily fwd\+\_\+kin}, and {\ttfamily inv\+\_\+kin}. These functions are defined later in the code.
\item These functions are used to calculate and print the Jacobian matrix, perform forward kinematics, and perform inverse kinematics for the robotic arm.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item $\ast$$\ast${\ttfamily fwd\+\_\+kin} Function$\ast$$\ast$\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This function calculates the forward kinematics of the robotic arm based on joint angles ({\ttfamily theta}) and stores the end-\/effector position in the {\ttfamily x} array.
\item It uses the arm\textquotesingle{}s geometric parameters and trigonometric calculations to determine the end-\/effector position.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item $\ast$$\ast${\ttfamily inv\+\_\+kin} Function$\ast$$\ast$\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This function calculates the inverse kinematics of the robotic arm to determine the joint angles ({\ttfamily theta}) needed to reach a specified end-\/effector position ({\ttfamily x}).
\item It performs mathematical calculations to find the joint angles based on the given end-\/effector position and arm geometry.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item $\ast$$\ast${\ttfamily jacobian} Function$\ast$$\ast$\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This function calculates the Jacobian matrix for the robotic arm.
\item The Jacobian matrix relates the rate of change of the end-\/effector\textquotesingle{}s position to the rates of change of the joint angles.
\item It computes the Jacobian matrix elements using partial derivatives with respect to joint angles.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item $\ast$$\ast${\ttfamily print\+\_\+jacobian} Function$\ast$$\ast$\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This function is responsible for printing the Jacobian matrix to the console.
\item It takes the Jacobian matrix as input and formats and prints its elements.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Overall, this code provides a framework for working with a robotic arm, allowing you to perform forward kinematics to calculate the end-\/effector position given joint angles and inverse kinematics to determine joint angles given an end-\/effector position. Additionally, it computes and prints the Jacobian matrix, which is essential for tasks like velocity control and trajectory planning in robotics.\hypertarget{md_readme_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysection{Contributions}\label{md_readme_autotoc_md5}
